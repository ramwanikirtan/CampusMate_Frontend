## **🚀 Project Motivation**

The primary goal of **Campus Mate** is to centralize academic resources and provide students with a comprehensive platform to manage their courses, ask questions, collaborate on projects, and get access to detailed subject information. The frontend is designed to make these features easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience for students.

**Campus Mate** addresses key challenges faced by students, such as:

* **📚 Disorganization of Resources**: Often, academic materials are scattered across multiple platforms and formats, making it difficult for students to stay organized.
* **💬 Lack of Immediate Support**: Students often struggle to find immediate assistance for academic questions or course-related queries.
* **🤝 Limited Collaboration**: Many students lack an easy way to collaborate with peers or tutors on academic projects.

By providing a centralized platform with easy access to videos, notes, code, and live interaction with tutors and peers, **Campus Mate** aims to resolve these issues and create an environment where students can excel in their academic journey.

* **Tailwind CSS**: The project uses **Tailwind CSS**’s utility classes directly in the HTML/JSX to create a responsive layout. You can easily customize Tailwind to match the platform’s design and branding.

* **React Components**: The frontend is organized into reusable **React** components, each dedicated to specific features, such as the **Queries Section**, **Courses**, and **Projects**. This modular approach makes the codebase clean and easy to maintain.

* **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Using **Vite**, the development server supports fast hot reloading, so changes to the code instantly reflect in the browser without needing a refresh.
